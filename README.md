# 16RM-OS
16 Bit realtime mode operating system made fully in assembly

# Todo List
- ~~Kernel loading other programs~~
- Kernel either staying in 16bit or going in vt8086 mode
- Minimum requirements
- Basic terminal or tty
- Basic drivers for the Kernel for reading the Keyboard, Priting to the Screen, reading from the Disk etc.
- Debuging with Bochs
- Remove the Disk read Driver from the Bootloader and moving it as a Driver
- Better File structure
- FAT 12 Subdirectory
- If going in 32bit Long Mode with vt8086 mode add FAT32 File system
